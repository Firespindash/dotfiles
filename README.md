My personal desktop customization and backup. \
For now it isn't completed and it isn't a complete backup. \
It also includes a theme customization called River. \
The theme is based on the _Taucho_ _GTK_ theme from @emhaye, and it is based on the _Akava-Kv_ _Kvantum_ theme from @Nourepide. \
The theme is focused in the usage of high quality blur effect, some roundness, and consistency, with big fonts. \
![Desktop Customization](desktop-screenshot.png)
It's Manjaro Mate with _Tela-circle-black-dark_ icon theme, and _Comfortaa_ and _Terminus_/_Mono_ fonts at a size of 16px/17px. \
I started to use it as a daily driver now. \
## What is high quality blur effect?
It is a true blur effect that works with window backgrounds and roundness, where the windows remain with its original opacity, in general it's 1 or 100%, also can be like 0.99, while a theme provides the necessary transparency effect, creating a nice effect that you can still have a improved readability, and with good contrast. This means that just the background of the window has transparency applied, not the text, and not necessarily the entire window. \
## Background history
It was actually difficult to make it, I worked on it for some months, and plan to add much more things. About the appearance it is almost done, but in terms of behavior and functionality there are much to do yet. During the process of doing this customization, I got sick many times, I got demotivated, because none of my friends or my parents knew that I was working on it. And I had really focus hungry things near me interrupting sometimes. That was really work intensive, so I want to take a break for a while. Nevertheless I hope this help someone when doing it's own customization, or theme, or to have a better desktop experience. The actual name of the theme (River), was planned to be Rover, but it kept coming to mind when thinking about the theme development.

# Known Issues
Issues that I need help to solve, or will probably get to solve one day. If you find other issues, feel free to report. \
* River gtk background seems to be completely opaque in some windows, maybe because of my environment.
* mate-control-center background seems to not support any transparency.
* Rofi theme, -hover-select seems not work at all.
* River gtk2 and gtk3/4 seems to render some assets and elements a bit different, mainly the arrows.
* River qt has a problem with not drawing the borders of buttons, entries and combos, when they are disabled.
* River qt, maybe because of my environment, seems to paint text black in some cases, probably meaning that it's using a different color scheme.
* Metacity theme, or marco theme, seems to have buttons slightly smaller than the ideal.
