My personal desktop customization and backup. \
For now it isn't completed and it isn't a complete backup. \
It also includes a theme customization called River. \
The theme is based on the _Taucho_ _GTK_ theme from @emhaye, and it is based on the _Akava-Kv_ _Kvantum_ theme from @Nourepide. \
The theme is focused in the usage of high quality blur effect, some roundness, and consistency, with big fonts. \

It's Manjaro Mate with _Tela-circle-black-dark_ icon theme, and _Comfortaa_ and _Terminus_/_Mono_ fonts at a size of 16px/17px. \

## What is high quality blur effect?
It is a true blur effect that works with window backgrounds and roundness, where the windows remain with its original opacity, in general it's 1 or 100%, also can be like 0.99, while a theme provides the necessary transparency effect, creating a nice effect that you can still have a improved readability, and with good contrast. This means that just the background of the window has transparency applied, not the text, and not necessarily the entire window. \
## Background history
It was actually difficult to make it, I worked on it for some months, and plan to add much more things. About the appearance it is almost done, but in terms of behavior and functionality there are much to do yet. During the process of doing this customization, I got sick many times, I got demotivated, because none of my friends or my parents knew that I was working on it. And I had really focus hungry things near me interrupting sometimes. That was really work intensive, so I want to take a break for a while. Nevertheless I hope this help someone when doing it's own customization, or theme, or to have a better desktop experience. The actual name of the theme (River), was planned to be Rover, but it kept coming to mind when thinking about the theme development. I will temporarily stop using it as a daily driver, because all the development has being done in my real machine, but now things are starting to get a bit unstable, so I want to keep the development on a Virtual Machine in the future. And now the desired desktop visual was achieved, it was missing the dock bar. Now it comes with the desktop configs too, and I plan to do an automatic installer script, and also change to Arch.
## Widgets
For now there are two widgets: the dock bar, and the fullscreen logout widget. The reason why I made the dock bar is because I haven't found any other dock on my search, that could be able to be really anywhere on the screen, and mainly, able to be not just on the edge of the desktop. And at the same time, simple. The shell script containing all the functionalities has a bit more than 100 lines and it's really lightweight, not consuming almost any memory. And its only dependency is _eww_ widget system, and so _Rust_. Still it doesn't have fancy animations nor drag-and-drop support for a while. But it is also able of having other types of files, not just launchers, like videos, photos, and you can add a file from any directory. The icon theme is chosen automatically, but you can change it inside the script to another theme right on its beginning. Some apps may not have an icon version matching on your theme, so you will have to tweak it manually, on the **apps.yuck** file, I recommend choosing an icon that does represent well what type of app it is. For example, I did it with my web browser _Falkon_, because it doesn't have a matching icon, so I changed the icon to the web browser icon, as you can see in the **apps.yuck**. I also had to change how my terminal app _Alacritty_ opens, because it was behaving differently than the expected, opening in the specific directory that the **exec** file was, in that cases you simply have to change how the app is called in the **exec** file. Mouse click opens app, right click let you edit it (add or remove app), and it doesn't save any changes done in the **apps.yuck** and **exec** files. \
The reason why I made the logout screen widget is because none of the logout widgets that I found, had at the same time: support for shortcuts, be capable of configuring colors and capable to go fullscreen. And I made this widget with _PyQt5_ and it has all these things. If you want to install it, please read the INSTALL file.
# Known Issues
Issues that I need help to solve, or will probably get to solve one day. If you find other issues, feel free to report. \
* River gtk background seems to be completely opaque in some windows, maybe because of my environment.
* mate-control-center background seems to not support any transparency.
* River gtk2 and gtk3/4 seems to render some assets and elements a bit different, mainly the arrows.
* River qt has a problem with not drawing the borders of buttons, entries and combos, when they are disabled.
* River qt, maybe because of my environment, seems to paint text black in some cases, probably meaning that it's using a different color scheme.
* Metacity theme, or marco theme, seems to have buttons slightly smaller than the ideal.
