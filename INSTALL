These are instructions on how to install this customization
It's also recommended that you have installed the apps that are expected to be there in the configs. Mainly compton-tryone and the ones from eww:
dolphin, alacritty, mpv, gedit, falkon, timeshift and qview.

 Mate: 
   To restore desktop customized settings.
   
   dconf load / < mate/mate-backup 
   
   cp mate/marco-compton.conf ~/.config/ 
   
   cp -r mate/autostart/ ~/.config/ 
   cp -r mate/panel/panel2.d/ ~/.config/mate/ 

River-theme:
   To install River theme.
   
   mv River-theme/ ~/.themes/River/ 
   mv ~/.themes/River/GTK/* ~/.themes/River/ 
   rm -rf ~/.themes/River/GTK/ 
   rm -rf ~/.themes/River/dev/ 
   rm -rf ~/.themes/River/Kvantum/dev/ 
   rm -rf ~/.themes/River/metacity-1/dev/ 
   rm -rf ~/.themes/River/extra-assets/dev/ 

Logout-screen: 
   To install the logout widget.
   
   cp -r !(logout-screen/share) logout-screen/ ~/.config/ 
   
   mv logout-screen/share/ ~/.local/share/logout-screen/ 
   rm -rf ~/.local/share/logout-screen/dev/ 

Rofi: 
   To install rofi app launcher.
   
   mv rofi/ ~/.config/rofi/ 
   
Eww:
   To install dock bar of apps, eww widgets.
   For it, you will need the rust nightly toolchain.
   
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh 
   rustup default nightly 

   You can get rid of rustup after. 

   git clone https://github.com/elkowar/eww 
   cd eww/ 
   cargo build --release 
   chmod +x target/release/eww 
   mv target/release/eww ~/bin/eww 
   
   And test the bin to see if it's working.
   
   cd ../ 
   mv eww/* ~/.config/eww/ 
   cp -r !(eww/share) eww/ ~/.config/ 
   mv eww/share/ ~/.local/share/eww/ 

Wallpaper:
   To set the nice wallpaper change it to where you want to.
   After, set it in the Mate Control Center. Example:
   
   mv wallpaper/leafs-improved.png ~/Images/wallpapers/ 

Done, now you can even remove this directory.

cd ../ && rm -rf dotfiles/
