These are instructions on how to install this customization
It's also recommended that you have installed the apps that are expected to be there in the configs. Mainly compton-tryone and the ones from eww:
thunar, alacritty-ligatures, mpv, gedit, falkon, timeshift and qview.
 
Global Menu:
   To install topmenu on panel.

   pacman -S appmenu-gtk-module 
   
   yay -S vala-panel-appmenu-registrar-git 

   pacman -S cmake 

   yay -S vala-panel-appmenu 
   
   Then, there may be an error to be fixed.
   
   cd ~/.cache/yay/vala-panel-appmenu/ 

   Edit in the PKGBUILD file setting the following:
   _disable_xfce=false to true
   _disable_vala=true

   And done:
   
   makepkg -si

River-theme:
   To install River theme.
   
   Create if it doesn't exist.
   
   mkdir ~/.themes/ 
   
   mv River-theme/ ~/.themes/River/ 
   mv ~/.themes/River/GTK/* ~/.themes/River/ 
   rm -rf ~/.themes/River/GTK/ 
   rm -rf ~/.themes/River/dev/ 
   rm -rf ~/.themes/River/Kvantum/dev/

      First, download the Tela-circle-black.tar.xz in Files(13) on the link:
      https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1359276/

      And create if it doesn't exist.

      cd ~/.icons/ 
      
      tar -xf Tela-circle-black.tar.xz 
      rm -rf Tela-circle-black.tar.xz 

      sudo cp -r ~/.icons/Tela-circle-black /usr/share/icons/

   For it, you will need the rust nightly toolchain.

   And just proceed and reload bash:

   source $HOME/.cargo/env 
   rustup default nightly 

   You can get rid of rustup after.

   cd ../ 
   git clone https://github.com/elkowar/eww 
   cd eww/ 
   cargo build --release 
   chmod +x target/release/eww 
   mv target/release/eww ~/bin/eww 
   
   And test the bin to see if it's working.
   
   cd ~/dotfiles/ 
   cp -r eww/ ~/.config/ 
   mv ~/.config/eww/share/ ~/.local/share/eww/

   To set the nice wallpaper change it to where you want to.
   After, set it in the Mate Control Center. Example:
