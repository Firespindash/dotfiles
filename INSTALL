These are instructions on how to install this customization
It's also recommended that you have installed the apps that are expected to be there in the configs. Mainly compton-tryone and the ones from eww:
thunar, alacritty-ligatures, celluloid, gedit, falkon, timeshift and qview.

   To install topmenu on panel.

   pacman -S appmenu-gtk-module 
   
   yay -S vala-panel-appmenu-registrar-git

   yay -S vala-panel-appmenu 
   
   Then, there may be an error to be fixed.
   
   cd ~/.cache/yay/vala-panel-appmenu/ 

   Edit in the PKGBUILD file setting the following:
   _disable_xfce=false to true

   And done:
   
   makepkg -si 
   cd ~/dotfiles/

   chmod +x target/release/eww 
   mv target/release/eww ~/bin/eww 
   
   And test the bin to see if it's working.

   cp -r dotconfig/eww/ ~/.config/ 
   mv ~/.config/eww/share/ ~/.local/share/eww/
